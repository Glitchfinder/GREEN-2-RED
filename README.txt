  RED is a continuation of the development that went into theory's old RMXP
game, GREEN. Where that game fell short due to the constraints of RPG Maker,
this game aims to shine as something significantly better. However, RED is not
GREEN. In this game, you start off as RED, rather than the more familiar GREEN.
He has different abilities, a different color, but the same goal: to survive as
long as possible, and to collect as much treasure as possible.
